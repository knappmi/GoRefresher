# Fundamental Problems

1. fizzbuzz_variant - Produce Fizz/Buzz/Pop for multiples of 3/5/7 with extensible rule set.
2. reverse_unicode - Reverse a UTF-8 string preserving grapheme clusters.
3. fibonacci - Compare recursive, iterative, and memoized Fibonacci implementations + benchmarking.
4. json_struct - Marshal/unmarshal JSON with custom field tags and omitempty behavior.
5. word_count - Word frequency counter reading from stdin or file.
6. shape_interface - Define Shape interface and implement Area/Perimeter for multiple shapes.
7. custom_error - Create sentinel, wrapped, and typed errors with errors.Is / errors.As usage.
8. file_linecount - Count lines in large file efficiently (bufio) with tests.

Each problem has its own folder with a stub. Implement production-quality code and add tests ( *_test.go ).
